		<h1>📊 GTM & GA Demo</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome to the <strong
				>Google Tag Manager & Google Analytics Demo</strong
			> project.
		</p>
		<p>
			This website serves as a practical sandbox to demonstrate and verify
			the integration of
			<strong>Google Tag Manager (GTM)</strong> and <strong
				>Google Analytics (GA4)</strong
			> within a modern
			<a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> application.
		</p>
		<p>
			The primary goal is to provide a clean, controlled environment to
			test tracking implementations, debug data layer events, and ensure
			that analytics data is flowing correctly.
		</p>
		<p>Here's what you can explore:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>GTM Integration:</strong> Verify how the GTM container code
				is injected into the
				<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of every
				page.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Data Layer:</strong> Check the console and GTM Preview mode
				to see how events are pushed to the data layer.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>GA4 Tracking:</strong> Observe real-time data collection
				in Google Analytics as you navigate the site.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Check out the <a href={import.meta.env.BASE_URL + "blog"}>Blog</a> for
			detailed guides on how this integration was built.
