	<p>
		This project was created with a single purpose: to master the
		integration of Google's marketing and analytics tools.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the world of digital marketing and web development, accurate data
		collection is paramount.
		<strong>Google Tag Manager</strong> acts as the bridge between the website
		and various tracking tools, while <strong>Google Analytics</strong> provides
		the insights needed to make data-driven decisions.
	</p>

	<p>This demo site allows for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Testing complex GTM triggers and variables.</li>
		<li>Verifying cross-domain tracking configurations (if applicable).</li>
		<li>Experimenting with server-side tagging.</li>
		<li>Ensuring compliance with consent modes.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		It is built using <strong>Astro</strong> for its performance and simplicity,
		ensuring that the tracking scripts do not negatively impact the user experience
		or Core Web Vitals.
